* Showcase diverse uses of AlmaLinux.

* Promote the quality of AlmaLinux.
* Promote AlmaLinux and its uses.

AlmaLinux and how AlmaLinux is being used - Images/Screenshots.

**Wish:** Persons being interviewed/showcased should not be the usual suspects. Try to get people from the wider community. It could be you!

**Wish:** Video would be nice and would allow additional promotion on various channels.
